      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Traditional games in India have been played for centuries and are deeply woven into our culture and history. 
        From outdoor team sports like Kabaddi and Kho-Kho to board games such as Pachisi (the precursor to Ludo) and 
        strategy games like chess, these games not only provide entertainment but also teach valuable lessons in teamwork, 
        strategy, and moral values.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this blog, we celebrate these traditional games, their historical roots, and their continued relevance in today's digital age.

      <h2>History & Cultural Significance</h2>
      <p>
        The origins of many traditional Indian games can be traced back to ancient scriptures and epics. For example, 
        the Mahabharata mentions dice games and strategic board games that later evolved into Pachisi. Over time, games like 
        Kabaddi and Kho-Kho became integral parts of rural life and were even revived through modern leagues such as the 
        Pro Kabaddi League. These games also served as a medium for teaching life skills and moral values – ladders in the 
        game of Moksha Patam symbolized virtues, while snakes represented vices.
      </p>
      <p>
        The British colonial era saw the transformation of some of these games into modern variants, while today, initiatives 
        by the government and cultural festivals aim to preserve and promote this heritage.

          Jallikattu is a traditional bull-taming sport primarily played in Tamil Nadu during the Pongal festival. It involves participants

          symbol of rural bravado and cultural heritage, with local tournaments and passionate supporters keeping the tradition alive.
